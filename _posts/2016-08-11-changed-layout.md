I got tired of seeing my page's animation every time I went to a different part of my page so I made them a little more plain. Will consider adding more animations and transitions later on.

Just started going through "Cracking the Coding Interview" and I'm learning a lot. Can't wait to see what else is in store.

On an unrelated note, I started watching "W" and I'm hooked. Love the story line and the characters. Lee Jong-Suk and Han Hyo-Joo are doing an amazing job. Also, I can't wait to see the men's 200 IM tonight.
