Spent most of today working on bugs in [Foodsy](http://foodsy.xyz). The most annoying bug I had to deal with today
was in my jbuilder for reviews.

The initial issue was that I was doing some back-end
work with Javascript. The problem occurred when I moved it to the back end. I was
unable to extract the correct data from my data base. After spending an hour playing
around with jbuilder and scanning through the readme, I remembered that I can render
partials in jbuilder. After I implemented the fix, I was able to extract the correct
data from the database!
