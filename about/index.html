			<p>
				I was born and raised in the Bay Area where I'm still currently located.
				I've always loved problem solving and building small projects like Lego
				fortresses and oragami. Hobbies include puzzles, swimming, and following
				the League of Legends competative scene.
				<br><br>
        I graduated May 2015 from Carnegie Mellon University with a BS in
				Mechanical Engineering but switched when I discoverd my passion for web
				development. I acquired my knowledge of Rails, Ruby, and Javascript from App Academy. A
				collection of projects that use the listed technologies can be found in
				<a href="/projects">projects</a>.
