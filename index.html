			<p>
				I was born and raised in San Jose, California.
				I've always loved problem solving and building small projects like Lego
				fortresses and oragami. My hobbies include puzzles, swimming, volleyball, basketball and working out.
				<br><br>
        I graduated May 2015 from Carnegie Mellon University with a BS in
				Mechanical Engineering but switched to software engineering when I discoverd my passion for programming.
				I decided to pursue my passion by applying for App Academy where I learned Rails , Ruby, and Javascript.
				In order to further expand my knowledge in the field of software engineering I pursued and completed a Masters
				in computer science from The University of Texas at Austin in May 2022.
				A	collection of projects that I've worked on can be found in
				<a href="./projects">projects</a>.
